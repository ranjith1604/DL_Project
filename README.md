# DL_Project
* A Multi-Layer FeedForward Neural Network was trained on the MNIST Fashion Dataset.This would also be generating fin.csv as outputs for the test data.
* The Cifar100 dataset file is already included with both the notebooks.
One of the notebooks has code which is making the model from scratch while the other is using transfer learning
Both the notebooks would be generating a fin.csv file at the end which includes predictions for the test data
